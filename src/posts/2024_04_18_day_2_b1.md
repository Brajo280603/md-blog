### Free Practice
Stroll got pole and track on fire who would have thought.

### Sprint Qualifying
The track's on fire again and it rained thats a  180 who would have thought. And finally a Race with no dutch domination.
Alonso P3ðŸŽ‰

### final thoughts of the day 

So currently learning to write more atleast more than yesterday lol.
Will definitely take time to write something good or even worth to read for the matter, but nevertheless still try.
