## üèÜSprint
Ok, So lando just let everyone passthrough ,
And 
we are back to Verstappen dominations , who would've expected that? 

10 seconds lead in 10 laps thats some power.

And the contest for 3rd place between Alonso , Leclerc , Perez and Sainz was awesome.


## Qualifyings
Hamilton out of Q1 thats a huge shock.

Smooth Operator didn't had a smooth operation, but got a smooth comeback.

Wow that Q3 in great.
